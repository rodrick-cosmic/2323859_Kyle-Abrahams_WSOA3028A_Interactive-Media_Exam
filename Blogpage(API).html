              JavaScript Libraries OR How to Program For Lazy People</h2>
            <div class="underline"></div>
          </div>
          
          <p> This was an interesting concept and topic for me to research as I always wondered if there were much more easier ways to implement certain functionality in my website. I wondered if there was some sort of way to ‘code smarter not harder’ and lo and behold there was in fact one, several actually, these came in the form of what developers term, JavaScript Dependencies/Libraries/API’s. </p>
 <p> JavaScript libraries, in general, are collections of prewritten code fragments that may be used and reused to carry out standard JavaScript operations. The code of a specific JavaScript library may be inserted in and out of the rest of your project's code as necessary. This accelerated development and reduced error-prone areas.</p>
<p> These were designed in response to the JavaScript community observing certain patterns in the code were being utilized repeatedly to carry out the same tasks as JavaScript's use and adoption grew among developers of websites and apps. The creation of JavaScript libraries and frameworks was a result of the necessity to rewrite some of the code and the realization that some JS methods needed to be written more than once. </p>
<br> While doing research I also came across another JavaScript concept-JavaScript Frameworks. </br>
<p> Consider the discussion between JavaScript libraries and JavaScript frameworks. People frequently refer to libraries as frameworks and frameworks as libraries when using these words interchangeably. What do these phrases actually signify, though? Aren’t JS frameworks and libraries the same thing, different names? Not quite. </p>
<p> Front end developers (those who create the portions of a website or web app that users view on their screens) utilize the scripting language JavaScript (abbreviated JS) to implement and manage dynamic content. Although there are other programming languages available, such as Python, JS is the most popular. </p> 
<p> Dynamic content is everything you see when using a website or app that "changes" on screen without you having to manually reload. This includes dynamic visuals, interactive forms, photo carousels, and more. When you type search terms into Google's search field, an autocomplete tool appears. JavaScript is being used there.</p>
<p> One of the biggest challenges I faced when it came to API’s was the fact that there was little to no explanations on how to integrate them into a website, and the content that did exist was for functionality that was better suited in an E-commerce setting such as online shopping tools, checkout pages etc. </p>
<p> While writing this I realised that I had previously dabbled in API’s while never fully understanding them, even now there is still so much that I am unsure of regarding these impressive technologies. In reconstructing my website I realised that in my “Built With JavaScript” section the weather app used an API, which at the time I was not even aware of. </p>



<p> Another aspect that proved to be a lot more difficult than I initially thought was the choosing of an API that actually benefits the site, which I, personally was unable to find, and rather I found several APIs that could almost function as added extras. So instead I decided to a fun little aspect would be adding another bit of interactivity or something to take away from the mundane aspects of the website. So initially I thought of having a built-in YouTuber player, but that would not serve much use. So the second idea I had was including a book database, something where users could read their favourite books off of. </p>
<p> Then I realised that would not necessarily align with the rest of my website. So instead, I started thinking of it in terms of maybe it was a catalogue of all the academic texts we dealt with this semester, I mean functionally that makes perfect sense, but the issue was develop something like that in such a short period of time. I mean I’m good, but not that good. </p>
<p>  So, I thought in spirit of having a section dedicated to the interactive, why not include another interactive bit, and so I decided maybe the best option would be adding ‘Sudoku’ to the website because that’s pretty fun and not too intensive, and best of all I found an API for it so it was to be a walk in the park. </p>
<p> Unfortunately that did not pan out as well as I thought it would. The entire project was working perfectly until it came time for me to migrate data to the backend so as to secure my API key however in doing so it seems as though I lost a lot of the game’s original functionality. Now I know this may sound like me coming up with excuses but, if anything it’s the opposite, or very close to the opposite. I write this not as a pity card but more as an explanation, and I am a firm believer in trying and failing than not trying at all, so that the next time I learn from the mistakes I made and I know where to improve. </p>
