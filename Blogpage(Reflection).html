          <p> Much like the first assignment I had a period wherein I debated whether to write one perspective for the technical component and another for the creative. This time, however, I can say I am going to write a mixed one, not for any specific reason, but I think for the sake of clarity I will separate them into their respective paragraphs. </p>
<p> ‘Since I've never been the best at programming, when I decided to enrol in this course, I questioned if I could handle learning yet another programming language after barely making it through C# for Game Design. I anticipated that this course would focus mostly on how to launch a website, study HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, and perform tasks associated with web developers. </p>
<p> I was instead inundated with readings that led me to doubt the very nature of the internet and the impact it has had on society. Which is not to say that I dislike the idea; quite the opposite, I believe it enabled us to examine how websites are developed, from their social implications to their effects on both users and creators, and how the idea of the "web" existed for years prior to its initial conception as something illusory and intangible. This block, in my opinion, also demonstrated the necessity for designers and artists to be aware of the market and environment.’ </p>
<p> I know I am regurgitating sentiments from the assignment 1 but in preparation for this assignment I decided to look back at my previous and see where and how I could improve. One of the key pointers I noticed was my lack of time management, which has plagued me for eternity, and that’s not exactly something that I can solve overnight. What is, would be how well I have been able to adjust and learn how to be a better programmer as the days have past. I still think my work needs a lot more in the way of following conventions and writing clearer and more concise code. One thing I picked up with looking through my old code is that a lot of it was like a cheap glue sticking together a fridge door that’s constantly being opened, and the glue is wearing out slowly but surely. I think my code for the most part is most definitely not professional or even presentable. </p>
<p> It was one of the bigger issues that I wanted to address for this exam submission, additionally I wanted to revamp the entire site and give it a face lift that looks presentable and a whole lot less tacky than what I initially had. I think overall the new look is a much better fit in terms of what I was going for in the first place, and it doesn’t hurt that it feels x10 more modern and legitimate. </p>
