                Using User Interface and User Expereince</h2>

            In preparation to write this analysis I went through a few different pieces of research to gain a much better understanding of how UI/UX related to my website, or rather how my website relates to UI/UX. <br></br> The first reading I went through was the “Semiotic-based Framework to User Interface Design” reading, I found it to be especially informative and from the onset the part that stuck out the most to me and informed the rest of the reading was <br></br> “Norman distinguishes the designer’s conceptual model from the user’s conceptual model that should be matched by interacting with the System Image. The system image is the external view that the user and the designer share to 
understand the conceptual model.” 
<br></br>
Now observing this quote in relation to my website I came to a revelation. <br></br> That UI/UX is something that by now should have become second nature for many, because the basis of it is if the designer can use their system without issues, so can the consumer/user? <br></br>
Unfortunately this is where the disconnect takes place, and I think my website is extremely guilty of this. <br></br> The thinking that because the designer (who more often than not has far more experience with the product) is able to use it, anyone can. <br></br>The problem with this is fairly obvious, not everyone has the same technical skills as a designer. <br></br>Yet, are expected to use a system as though they are. That’s not possible, it’s like asking a gardener to use a supercomputer to do lightspeed calculations. The gardener won’t know where to start, unless there’s instructions, be it social cues or even design cues.<br></br> I think my website for the most part, is easy to use if you know the conventions of a basic website but when I look at other modern websites a lot of the aspects of my website can in fact be simplified or even make use of more semiotics. <br></br> So instead of using written words I could use a sign that equates the function of the word, for instance, instead of the words “exit” you could use a silhouette of a figure running left.<br></br>
Looking at my website, I also noticed something I previously overlooked-colour. The colour aspect of a website is very important I’d even argue that good design at least visually can distract from bad web principles, although the two cannot be separated, they work in tandem. The colour aspect is one of the more important factors in successful UI/UX design as it essentially the first thing your eyes see, therefore if the colours (or lack thereof) are too distracting from the text, or other visuals, the design will not be working in harmony. I go back to my site, looking back on it with the readings in mind and Peta’s lecture in specific, the idea of how the usability of a website is influenced by the context also had me thinking about certain design choices. To illustrate my last remark, it is the thinking that a online shop’s layout and design, will (ideally) be vastly different to a tourism site. Therefore, a portfolio site’s context should be understood almost instant as a portfolio site. I look at my site and from what I can tell it seems correct for the most part, granted there is room for improvement (there always is), and there isn’t much I could change without compromising the layout.<br></br> The layout of the website, in my opinion is effective as the desktop version is simple to navigate and easy to understand what goes where. It can however be improved in terms of the mobile version, for my upcoming assignment I’m hoping I can iron out this issue and optimize it better for mobile devices. Reason being, in modern day most people access websites via their phones and so it only makes sense that every website has various measures in place to cater for multiple devices being able to experience the website to its fullest.
