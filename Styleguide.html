          <img class = "StyleGuide" src="Color palette.jpg">
          <p1> With the overall color palette for my website I thought having warm and cool hues combined to create a colorful yet not overwhelming feeling. I think the appeal came from how it created a very youthful and modern design. The light greens and earthy terracottas I think work to create a nice contrast that isn't too agressive.  Edit: So after some experimentation and getting some second opinions regarding different color combinations, I ultimately decided, that for now at least, I am going to stick with these colors as I think they compliment each other fairly well and I think above everything else they create a nice harmony without being too overbearing.</p1>

        </div>
<p3> Edit: The two images above are screenshots, wherein I did a little color change, I think while they are a little bit of an eye sore, and feel a bit over-the-top I think there is definitely an appeal, and one I would like to explore further in the next submission. </p3>

 
<img class = "StyleGuidePage" src="Screenshot 2022-06-10 101346.jpg" alt="Styleguide thumbnails go here!">
<p3> Edit: Going forward, I think I want to approach a more minimalistic aesthetic something akin to the above screenshot, and perhaps even have everything laid out on one webpage and the user scrolls down to the relevant page. The only issue I can see off the bat is how this design may not be the most ideal especially in this context.</p3>

    <img class = "StyleGuidePage" src="Screenshot 2022-04-21 211237.jpg" alt="Styleguide thumbnails go here!">
    <p3>Above is the website that the bare bones of my designs originate from, partially because I followed a tutorial which helped build that site, and also because I just felt like the site was modern, sleek and retained a edge of professionalism despite feeling fun as well. </p3>

            <div class="blog-heading">
                <h3>Wireframes</h3>
            </div>

            <img class = "StyleGuidePage" src="DraftWireframe.jpg" alt="Styleguide thumbnails go here!">
            <p1> This was the very first iteration of my website. It was very crude and basic with hardly any details.  I envisioned it having a log-in & sign-up screen. I also began thinking about how the website would look on a mobile device.</p1>
        
                <img class = "StyleGuidePage" src="HomepageWireframe.jpg" alt="Styleguide thumbnails go here!">

            <p1>This is the first wireframe I drafted after seeing the tutorial. With it I wanted to bring my own spin to the website and making it mine instead of just using the tutorial. Additionally, I thought some aspects would not be suited to what I wanted to do. </p1> 

            <img class = "StyleGuidePage" src="BlogWireframe.jpg" alt="Styleguide thumbnails go here!">

            <p1> I think this took me the longer to plot out and implement than I intially thought, because there were so many options to choose from, and it was not easy to find the exact one that I needed. However, the most difficult aspect, would definitely be how I needed conceptualize how a blog would look like and how I could fit it into my website.</p1>

            <img class = "StyleGuidePage" src="PortfolioWireframe.jpg" alt="Styleguide thumbnails go here!">

            <p1> I wanted the portfolio section to look more like a catalogue, something you would see on Steam or Epic Games library, just to give it that game feel. Additionally, I wanted it to be more experimental and abstract than the rest of my site. </h1>
